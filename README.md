# General description

A trait-based model of coral-algae symbiosis to study the adaptation of coral-algae symbiosis. The model assumes that only the corals adapt to maintain the symbiotic relationship because corals controls the fluxe of nutrients through various processes and algae growth are highly regulated. In the model, the algae biomass is assumed to be proportional to the coral biomass. The symbiont to coral biomass ratio (S:C) is considered as a parameter.

# Coral adaptation to symbiosis

Coral adaptation to symbiosis is captured by assuming that the temporal dynamics of a physiological trait, reflecting the energy that corals invest in the symbiotic relationship, is proportional to the gradient of coral fitness (assumed equal to net coral growth). 

# The survival range of coral-algae complex

The result show that the survival range of the coral-algae symbiosis depends on the symbiont to coral biomass ratio and the cost of symbiosis. When the cost of symbiosis, then the coral-algae complex can thrive for a broad range of symbiont to host biomass ratio. This survival range narrows down as the cost of symbiosis increases.
